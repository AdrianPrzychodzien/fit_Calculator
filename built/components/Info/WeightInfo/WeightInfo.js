          Losing weight is usually <b>not a linear process</b>.
          <br /><br />
          Some days and weeks you may lose weight,
          while during others you may gain a little bit.
          <br /><br />
          <b>This is not a cause for concern</b>. Itâ€™s normal for body weight
          to fluctuate up and down by a few kg. For example, you may
          be carrying more food in your digestive
          system or holding on to more water than usual.
          <br /><br />
          This is even more pronounced in women, as water weight can
          fluctuate significantly during the menstrual cycle.
          <br /><br />
          As long as the <b>general trend</b> is going downwards, no matter how much it
          fluctuates, you will still succeed in losing weight <b>over the long term</b>.
          <br /><br />
          The same applies to the process of building muscle mass.
